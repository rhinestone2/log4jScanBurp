# Introduction

log4jScan is a burpsuite plugin for identifying log4j vulnerabilities

This plugin will detect incoming request packets from BurpSuite

The current functions are as follows
- Remote command execution

# detection rules

Currently only the following types are supported to scan for jndi vulnerabilities in log4j

- GET
- POST
- Cookies
- JSON
- Xml
- Body
- Header

# caution!!!!

<font color=red>After downloading, be sure to open /resources/config.yml to see the configuration file, there are many custom functions in it, you can choose freely!!</font>

It is recommended to use a burp2.x version, because in the new version of burp, passive scanning is automatically multi-threaded, so the scanning speed will be much faster.

Please download the source code by yourself and compile it with the same version of jdk as BurpSuite, thank you

# tag interface to view vulnerabilities

````
Vulnerabilities can now be viewed through the tag interface

will return respectively
- request parameter no eligible = request parameter is not eligible (controlled in scan type settings)
- the number of website problems has exceeded = exceeded
- the number of website scans exceeded = the number of website scans exceeded
- waiting for test results = waiting for test results
- [+] found log4j command execution = found log4j command execution
- [-] not found log4j command execution = No log4j command execution found
- [x] scan task timed out = scan task timed out
- [x] unknown error = unknown error
````

# Troubleshooting

What if there is a problem with the scan and I want to rescan?

For example, tag has the following problems:
- the number of website problems has exceeded = exceeded
- the number of website scans exceeded = the number of website scans exceeded
